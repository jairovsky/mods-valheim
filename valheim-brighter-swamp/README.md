# Valheim Brighter Swamp

This mod removes the artificial difficulty imposed by the Swamp's default low visibility. It increases the light intensity (the brightness) of the Swamp environment but leaves everything else (the overall hue/coloring) untouched. It still feels like you're in the Swamp, but you can now actually see the game.
